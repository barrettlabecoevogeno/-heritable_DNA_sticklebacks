# Heritable_DNA_sticklebacks

# This folder contains all R codes and cytosine coverage files (.cov) extracted using Bismark. All codes and files are used for analyzing # heritable DNA methylation in the stickleback study

# There are three R codes in total: 1) Analyzing general methylation patterns across three generations using principle component analysis # (PCA), 2) analyzing heritable methylation across F1 and F2 generations, and 3) analyzing methylation QTL (meQTL) in marine-freshwater   # hybrid F2 fish
